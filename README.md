Reactive Blocks Tutorial Game
=============
This is a tutorial game for learning how to use UML Activities in [Reactive Blocks](http://www.bitreactive.com/). It was made as part of my Master's Thesis at [NTNU](http://www.ntnu.no/), which is about learning how to use software modeling languages.

**Note:** Most of the artwork in this game is not originally made by me, but comes from various free sources (for non-commercial use).
